# User Decisions

This file contains direct quotes from user prompts that represent decisions made about the project. These decisions should not be violated by future edits.

## Development Process

> When working on multi-step parts, like processing a todo list, make git commits between each step. eg. between each todo list item

> When making significant changes, update CLAUDE.md and SPEC.md appropriately. Avoid this for things like bugfixing and style changes.

> Avoid adding verbose comments and unnecessary code or abstractions. Aim to be as short an concise as possible

> Avoid altering code / systems that are not part of the immediate task.

> When making any change, always load the DECISIONS.md to ensure that any change does not undo or otherwise goes against previous decisions. This file should only contain direct quotes from prompts from the user

---

## UI/Technology Choices

> a desktop app with the simplest possible UI implementation

> YAML for easier manual editing

> GPU acceleration as the default rendering mode

---

## Current Session

> read the todo.md file, and do all the remaining tasks there

> Update claude.md with .snerk info, and make a DOT-SNERK.md which describes the file structure of the .snerk file

> Make a markdown file where descisions are written down. The goal is that future edits will not violate any of the previous descicions.

> This file should only contain direct quotes from the user from their prompts
