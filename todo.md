todo:
- [x] All the black backgrounds in the UI should be opaque and with a blur filter
- [x] Support for rotating the images, and have that rotation be applied to the exports
- [x] Add a shortcut-overview when pressing "?" as well as adding a "?"-button in the bottom right which opens the same dialog
- [x] when setting rating, eg. ctrl+3, the filter also changes
- [x] alt+1-5 (setting zoom level) does not seem to work
- [x] The shortcut overview modal is larger than the window, so it is possible to scroll so that the header is out of the view or the footer. The header and footer should be stuck to the top/bottom of the window, and it should not be possible to scroll in that view
- [x] When clicking outside of a modal, the modal should close
- [x] Add a shortcut for 1:1 zoom level
- [x] Up and down arrows should rotate the photo
- [x] if all properties are "0" for a new color profile, then the image becomes completely black
- [x] Changing the tone curve is very slow. Make sure it does not do double-work, but triggering an update to the image, and reading the current values of the filters, and not queuing up multiple edits.
- [x] Reset zoom after a rotate is incorrect. It probably resets to the previous dimensions
- [x] Pan is incorrect after rotate, it seems linked to the old dimensions
- [ ] Create a .snerk file in the folder that is opened with metadata about the current state of the files that are being processed. Upon opening a folder, if it has a .snerk file, it should load that. The .snerk file stores which filters are stored to which files, what rotation, and so on. It is effectively a project-file for a folder. If a picture file, which is referenced in the .snerk file, is no longer in the folder, just ignore it. When saving, remove references which no longer exists. Every time a change is made, save the .snerk file, so there should not be a "Save" button anywhere. It is simply implicitly saved whenever a change is done. Also store the export-settings here, so two folders can have separate export settings.
- [ ] Pan is still not correct for all orientations
- [ ] Resetting zoom "Fit", is still incorrect after rotating
