todo:
- [x] Mouse drag-to-pan is not linked to zoom level, so it pans really fast in high zoom levels
- [x] The drag-to-pan does not work if zoomed out
- [x] The scroll zoom level is too sensitive, zooming in and out too quickly
- [x] Ability to "pin" preset style to one photo, so that that particular photo will use that preset when it is exported
- [x] Make a histogram graph that can be shown if pressing "i" on the keyboard. It should also show more info, like path to the file, and some exifdata
- [x] pressing, and holding, "p" should temporarily disable the style, so you can "preview" how it used to look quickly
- [x] When zooming, panning, and zooming out, the image snaps to the center. Don't do this, only do so if pressing the "fit" button
- [x] The histogram and Image Information must update if next/previous image is chosen by pressing left/right key
- [x] Date Taken in "Image Information" says "[object Object]"
- [x] When collapsing the preset pane, the element containing the expand button takes up the full height of the view
- [x] Add support for exporting raw files
- [x] Add support for adding stars to the exif data
- [x] The pin style to photo does not work, the style is changed when I change the style on a different photo, and go back to the photo with a pinned style. The UI should update to display the style which was pinned to that photo. In other words, there should be a "global" style, which is active by default for all photos, and a "Local style" for each photo if that is set.
- [x] Add support for full-screen mode by pressing f11
- [x] Pressing "p" does not temporarily disable the styling for pinned photos.
- [x] change f11 shortcut to "f", for full-screen
