- [x] Implement texture adjustment (new Lightroom feature)
- [x] Go through the xmp feature list and implement each missing feature (medium priority items)

- [x] Add a default background image when no folder is selected
- [x] Add a "show config" button to the right which will open the custom config modal with the currently selected preset. This modal should have a "copy to custom preset" which copies the current preset, and allows you to change it, unless it is already a custom preset, in which case you can configure it immediately
