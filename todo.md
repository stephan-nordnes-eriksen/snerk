todo:
- [x] All the black backgrounds in the UI should be opaque and with a blur filter
- [x] Support for rotating the images, and have that rotation be applied to the exports
- [x] Add a shortcut-overview when pressing "?" as well as adding a "?"-button in the bottom right which opens the same dialog
- [x] when setting rating, eg. ctrl+3, the filter also changes
- [x] alt+1-5 (setting zoom level) does not seem to work
- [x] The shortcut overview modal is larger than the window, so it is possible to scroll so that the header is out of the view or the footer. The header and footer should be stuck to the top/bottom of the window, and it should not be possible to scroll in that view
- [x] When clicking outside of a modal, the modal should close
- [x] Add a shortcut for 1:1 zoom level
- [x] Up and down arrows should rotate the photo
- [x] if all properties are "0" for a new color profile, then the image becomes completely black
- [x] Changing the tone curve is very slow. Make sure it does not do double-work, but triggering an update to the image, and reading the current values of the filters, and not queuing up multiple edits.
- [x] Reset zoom after a rotate is incorrect. It probably resets to the previous dimensions
- [x] Pan is incorrect after rotate, it seems linked to the old dimensions
