todo:
- [x] add support for xmp features like curves etc.

- [x] Zoom in feature to see image closer
- [x] Make the presets UI collapsible
- [x] modal pop-up for export configs
- [x] Make export configs that can be saved, eg. "jpeg quality 10 etc.", similar to how we have configs for style presets
- [x] editor for preset config, where you can create new custom presets with UI controls
- [x] Make UI for modifying preset configs with sliders and text-input, etc.
- [x] Update the default profiles. they are not correct now
- [x] Add a "no filter" button
- [x] Remove the dropdown for filters. The buttons are enough
- [x] Add a button to open the ~/.snerk folder in default folder program
- [x] Remove the dark background of the header and footer. I want it to be minimal overlay over the image
- [x] the title of the image is not correctly displayed between the previous / next buttons

- [x] remove the "snerk" logo at the top

- [x] Add an "about" page somewhere which says that this is GPL v3, and a link to the github page (https://github.com/stephan-nordnes-eriksen/snerk)
- [x] Disallow rename of default configs
- [x] Make a markdown todo-list for all of lightrooms XMP features, including tone curves, HSL/Color mixer, color grading, lens corrections, and more.

- [x] Implement texture adjustment (new Lightroom feature)
- [x] Go through the xmp feature list and implement each missing feature (medium priority items)
- [x] When making new configs, open the modal on the right-hand side and do not put a global overlay. When changing settings, they should be immediately visible in the displayed image.
- [x] Add a default background image when no folder is selected
- [x] Add a "show config" button to the right which will open the custom config modal with the currently selected preset. This modal should have a "copy to custom preset" which copies the current preset, and allows you to change it, unless it is already a custom preset, in which case you can configure it immediately
- [x] Add the ability to delete custom configs, including imported ones.
- [x] There are some problem when importing XMP. 1. The name of the xmp file is not fully set to the imported setting. It imports duplicates.
- [x] Fix problem: Arrow keys does not go to next / previous image
- [x] Make a way to run a preset config from the command line on a list of files, with a target output folder. This will be used for comparing the filters with a know good state
- [x] Fix problem: In weg gpu mode, the black and white filters is not actually black and white, but has color.
- [x] When deleting presets, other presets are being duplicated in the UI, and the one being deleted is not properly removed.
- [x] Remove the edit button next to the name of the presets, and move the rename-functionality into the preset editor section
- [x] Add support for more export formats. Possibly use ffmpeg as a conversion tool.
- [x] Add better input methods for curves
- [x] Prevent any kind of animation/delay on the images when changing configs, such as css transitions and so on.
- [x] If clicking the active preset, it should disable, and effectively set "no preset"
- [x] The exported image does not look like the one in the preview. Use the same exact processing for both preview and export.
- [x] Allow the user to zoom in to something like 30x resolution, and zoom out to something like 0.05x
- [x] The applied xmp does not look exactly like the one in lightroom
- [x] The curve controls must be an actual gui curve similar to how it is done in lightroom, eg. a 2d plot with a curve that starts in the bottom left, and goes to the top right, and where you can add points and control the curve.
