- [ ] Add more export output formats by using ffmpeg as the conversion tool
- [ ] If applicable, use ffmpeg for applying color profiles
- [ ] Make a markdown todo-list for all of lightrooms XMP features, including tone curves, HSL/Color mixer, color grading, lens corrections, and more.
- [ ] Go through the xmp feature list and implement each missing feature
- [ ] When making new configs, open the modal on the right-hand side and do not put a global overlay. When changing settings, they should be immediately visible in the displayed image.
