todo:
- [x] All the black backgrounds in the UI should be opaque and with a blur filter
- [x] Support for rotating the images, and have that rotation be applied to the exports
- [x] Add a shortcut-overview when pressing "?" as well as adding a "?"-button in the bottom right which opens the same dialog
- [ ] when setting rating, eg. ctrl+3, the filter also changes
- [ ] alt+1-5 (setting zoom level) does not seem to work
- [ ] The shortcut overview modal is larger than the window, so it is possible to scroll so that the header is out of the view or the footer. The header and footer should be stuck to the top/bottom of the window, and it should not be possible to scroll in that view
- [ ] When clicking outside of a modal, the modal should close
- [ ] Add a shortcut for 1:1 zoom level
- [ ] Up and down arrows should rotate the photo
