todo:
- [ ] Mouse drag-to-pan is not linked to zoom level, so it pans really fast in high zoom levels
- [ ] The drag-to-pan does not work if zoomed out
- [ ] The scroll zoom level is too sensitive, zooming in and out too quickly
- [ ] Ability to "pin" preset style to one photo, so that that particular photo will use that preset when it is exported
- [ ] Make a histogram graph that can be shown if pressing "i" on the keyboard. It should also show more info, like path to the file, and some exifdata
